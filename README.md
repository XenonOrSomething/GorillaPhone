# GorillaPhone
A phone for your gorilla tag!!! (work in progress, barely works lol)

## Current issues with the phone
- pretty bad button handling system
- highly unoptimised
- ~~hiding the phone barely works~~ (?)
- rotation of the phone is strange
- none of the apps work (they dont function)
- nothing really functions

## Credits (so far)
- chin0303, (helping me with assetbundles)
- striker67, (original idea)
- yizzi, (letting me ~~steal~~ use some of the logic from his button code)
